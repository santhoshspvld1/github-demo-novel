The Beginning
1 In the beginning 
2 Now the earth was formless and empty
3 And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 
4 God saw that the light was good
5 God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night
6 There be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.” 
7 So God made the vault
8 God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.
9 And God said, “Let the water under the sky
10 God called the dry ground “land"
